A colleciton of experiments that don't really fit anywhere else.


Including practice with a few programming languages.


```

C#

var t = 1;

Generative art, processing


```c#
 // Self invoking anonymous funciton:
 
 Console.WriteLine( new Func<string>( () => "Hello" )() );
```


Small talk

Car:square: double

```lisp
( define (isRoundNum num)

( =  (Ceiling num) (Floor num))


)


(define mod ( x y)
    (if (isRoundNum( (/ x y))
    ; TODO: fix this
    (mod x y-1)
    (-  x (/ x;y) )
)
```
